When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You might want to use a remote repository in order to keep all your work sharable or within easy access of others trying to 
work on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to pull changes manually in order to avoid becoming bogged down by git automatically updating i.e. git overwriting
files and conflicts arising.
