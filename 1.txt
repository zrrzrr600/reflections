How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot a bug?
It helped by comparing the two files clearly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It could help you compare the differences between two files clearly and more efficently than just having the first version only.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, 
like Google Docs does? 
Pros
-Easier to see the differences between files
-Easier to save when you want vs save when the computer wants you to save
-More likley to see differences between files vs seeing a huge number at once.
Cons
-Less likley to save more often
-Less likley to save in general
-Probrably not as easy as having the program save for you automatically

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You can use the commands seperatly in order to get a better idea of how you have changed your files over time, lines added or removed etc..

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
